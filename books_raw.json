Dick Award Nominee \"A compulsive, terrifying read.\"\u2014Kate Quinn, New York Times bestselling author of The Rose Code For readers of Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale comes a thrilling feminist dystopian novel set in an alternative history that terrifyingly imagines what a British alliance with Germany would look like if the Nazis had won WWII. To control the past, they edited history. To control the future, they edited literature. LONDON, 1953. Thirteen years have passed since England surrendered to the Nazis and formed a Grand Alliance with Germany. It was forced to adopt many of its oppressive ideologies, one of which was the strict classification of women into hierarchical groups based on the perceived value they brought to society. Rose Ransom, a member of the privileged Geli class, remembers life from before the war but knows better than to let it show. She works for the Ministry of Culture, rewriting the classics of English literature to ensure there are no subversive thoughts that will give women any ideas. Outbreaks of insurgency have been seen across the country with graffiti made up of seditious lines from forbidden works by women painted on public buildings. Suspicion has fallen on Widowland, the run-down slums where childless women over fifty have been banished. Rose is given the dangerous task of infiltrating Widowland to find the source of the rebellion before the Leader arrives in England for the Coronation ceremony of King Edward VIII and Queen Wallis. Will Rose follow her instructions and uncover the criminals? Or will she fight for what she knows in her heart is right? Praise for Widowland: \"A mind-bender of a novel about the power of literature to change minds. I loved it!\" \u2014Mark Sullivan, bestselling author of The Last Green Valley and Beneath a Scarlet Sky \"I rarely come across a book I can't put down but I devoured this one.\" \u2014Rhys Bowen, New York Times bestselling author of two historical mystery series as well as several internationally bestselling historical novels \"An electrifying, Orwellian dystopia with a thrilling feminist twist.\" \u2014Lara Prescott, New York Times bestselling author of The Secrets We Kept \"Tense, thought-provoking, and terrifying.\" \u2014Natalie Jenner, international bestselling author of The Jane Austen Society and Bloomsbury Girls",

In his bestselling A Planet for Rent, Yoss pays homage to Ray Bradbury\u2019s The Martian Chronicles and 334 by Thomas M. Disch. A critique of Cuba in the nineties, after the fall of the Soviet Union and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, A Planet for Rent marks the debut in English of an astonishingly brave and imaginative Latin American voice. Praise for Yoss \u201cOne of the most prestigious science fiction authors of the island.\u201d \u2014On Cuba Magazine \"A gifted and daring writer.\" \u2014David Iaconangelo \"Jos\u00e9 Miguel S\u00e1nchez [Yoss] is Cuba\u2019s most decorated science fiction author, who has cultivated the most prestige for this genre in the mainstream, and the only person of all the Island\u2019s residents who lives by his pen.\u201d \u2014Cuenta Regresiva Born Jos\u00e9 Miguel S\u00e1nchez G\u00f3mez, Yoss assumed his pen name in 1988, when he won the Premio David Award in the science fiction category for Timshel. Together with his peculiar pseudonym, the author's aesthetic of an impentinent rocker has allowed him to stand out amongst his fellow Cuban writers. Earning a degree in Biology in 1991, he went on to graduate from the first ever course on Narrative Techniques at the Onelio Jorge Cardoso Center of Literary Training, in the year 1999. Today, Yoss writes both realistic and science fiction works. Alongside these novels, the author produces essays, Praise for, and compilations, and actively promotes the Cuban science fiction literary workshops, Espiral and Espacio Abierto. When he isn\u2019t translating, David Frye teaches Latin American culture and society at the University of Michigan. Translations include First New Chronicle and Good Government by Guaman Poma de Ayala (Peru, 1615); The Mangy Parrot by Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Fernandez de Lizardi (Mexico, 1816), for which he received a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship; Writing across Cultures: Narrative Transculturation in Latin America by \u00c1ngel Rama (Uruguay, 1982), and several Cuban and Spanish novels and poems.",

Hating her ineffectual father, and troubled by a powerful attraction to a virile but dangerous loner who holds sway over the little colony, Pella sets out on a course of discovery that will have tragic and irrevocable consequences for the humans in the community and the ancient inhabitants, known only as archbuilders.

Thomas embarks on a program of using steroids and other chemicals to rapidly develop cognitive power of dogs, resulting in super sheep dogs. Sirius, however, proves to possess a dog intelligence comparable to a normal human being, as he is able to communicate with English words, although it takes some time for the humans to understand his canine pronunciation. He is born at the same time as his creator's human daughter, Plaxy, and the two of them are raised together as brother and sister. When Plaxy leaves for school they drift apart and troubles for Sirius begin. With human intelligence and emotion he declines to lead a life of a regular dog and he tends to develop as a person, but keeps running into obstacles.",

The way Kuthil Ash Kharn towers over me leaves me frozen in his shadow. I fight to keep control under the golden giant's penetrating gaze, but he sees right through me, and I just want to get through this job and go home. But a freak blizzard hits, leaving me trapped and injured at his ranch. With no way out, I have no choice but to allow Kuthil Ash Kharn to help me. Except his strange alien powers don\u2019t just heal me\u2014they come with unintended dark consequences. Now a part of him is inside of me, and it\u2019s impossible not to be overwhelmed by him. I feel him moving underneath my skin and I\u2019m doing my best to fight the way he manipulates my body and mind, but there\u2019s no escape. Not even in my dreams. And the worst thing of all is... I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m starting to enjoy it. Alien\u2019s Host is a steamy science fiction romance suitable for readers who like a strong heroine and are intrigued by a well-intentioned but possessive alien. This story was originally published in the Unwrapping the Alien anthology. It contains a revised ending with three additional chapters.",

            "description": "A bold fantasy in the tradition of Roger Zelazny's Chronicles of Amber, The Merchant Princes is a sweeping new series from the hottest new writer in science fiction! Miriam Beckstein is happy in her life. She's a successful reporter for a hi-tech magazine in Boston, making good money doing what she loves. When her researcher brings her iron-clad evidence of a money-laundering scheme, Miriam thinks she's found the story of the year. But when she takes it to her editor, she's fired on the spot and gets a death threat from the criminals she has uncovered. Before the day is over, she's received a locket left by the mother she never knew-the mother who was murdered when she was an infant. Within is a knotwork pattern, which has a hypnotic effect on her. Before she knows it, she's transported herself to a parallel Earth, a world where knights on horseback chase their prey with automatic weapons, and where world-skipping assassins lurk just on the other side of reality - a world where her true family runs things. The six families of the Clan rule the kingdom of Gruinmarkt from behind the scenes, a mixture of nobility and criminal conspirators whose power to walk between the worlds makes them rich in both. Braids of family loyalty and intermarriage provide a fragile guarantee of peace, but a recently-ended civil war has left the families shaken and suspicious. Taken in by her mother's people, she becomes the star of the story of the century-as Cinderella without a fairy godmother. As her mother's heir, Miriam is hailed as the prodigal countess Helge Thorold-Hjorth, and feted and feasted. Caught up in schemes and plots centuries in the making, Miriam is surrounded by unlikely allies, forbidden loves, lethal contraband, and, most dangerous of all, her family. Her unexpected return will supercede the claims of other clan members to her mother's fortune and power, and whoever killed her mother will be happy to see her dead, too. Behind all this lie deeper secrets still, which threaten everyone and everything she has ever known. Patterns of deception and interlocking lies, as intricate as the knotwork between the universes. But Miriam is no one's pawn, and is determined to conquer her new home on her own terms. Blending the creativity and humor of Roger Zelazny, the adventure of H. Beam Piper and Philip Jose Farmer, and the rigor and scope of a science-fiction writer on the grandest scale, Charles Stross has set a new standard for fantasy epics. At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.",

And now, with Project Cancelar, Control has formulated a plan for achieving immortality...a plan which requires as fodder the collapsing of the universe and the destruction of all life. And there is nothing the humans can do. But there is another force in the universe, hidden in the abyss of the Silent Quarter...plotting destruction of Control. A force that is about to be demolished! Before it expires, it launches from its depths a magic ring, an elixir, and a man and a woman in love - riding within the living spirit of a remarkable spaceship to do battle against the cumulative technology of the entire universe.",

The Beta Explorers have succeeded in their mission of terraforming planets to establish human colonies across the galaxy. But as the inhabitants of these new worlds come of age to govern themselves, their ambition plateaus and stagnates. Instead of continuing to pursue scientific advancement and space travel in the physical Betaverse, many prefer the simulated environment of the Metaverse, where they can live innumerable immortal lives, free from illness and harm. Separated from her fellow Betas, who individually transformed one world at a time, Angelique Komene cloned herself and produced hundreds of habitable planets. Through her clones, the Ange Angels, she has guided billions to create democratic societies. But when her people start embracing the Metaverse, one colony after another, the clones make a startling discovery: a virus code-designed to influence the humans under their care to reject science in reality-was uploaded into the Betas' simulated minds before their terraforming mission even began, presumably the work of the authoritarian government, which outlawed space exploration to keep humanity contained in the Metaverse. Now, it is up to Angelique and the Betas to implement an antivirus to purge the contagion and reclaim their autonomy from Earth once and for all. But what if the virus did not originate on Earth after all? It seems an alien civilization has been spreading its own colonies across the universe. And if humans do not return to their home planet, the aliens may destroy the entire race . . . The second volume of the hit science-fiction adventure series-originally released on Royal Road and perfect for fans of Bobiverse and Children of Time-now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!",

The book is designed to serve as a supplemental text for undergraduate political science courses, especially Introduction to Political Science. The structure and content of the volume is shaped around the organization and coverage of several leading texts in this area, and includes major parts devoted to theory and epistemology, political behavior, institutions, identity, states, and inter-state relations. Its emphasis on science fiction\u2014and particularly on popular movies and television programs\u2014speaks to the popularity of the genre as well as the growing understanding that popular culture can be an extraordinarily successful vehicle for communicating difficult yet foundational concepts, especially to introductory level college students.",

But all that is about to change, unless a neurotic, rule-following bureaucrat and an irreverent, freewheeling artificial intelligence can save the city from a mysterious terrorist plot that threatens its very existence. Henry Thompson has dedicated his life to improving America's infrastructure as a proud employee of the United States Municipal Survey. So when the agency comes under attack, he dutifully accepts his unexpected mission to visit Metropolis looking for answers. But his plans to investigate quietly, quickly, and carefully are interrupted by his new partner: a day-drinking know-it-all named OWEN, who also turns out to be the projected embodiment of the agency's supercomputer. Soon, Henry and OWEN are fighting to save not only their own lives and those of the city's millions of inhabitants, but also the soul of Metropolis. The Municipalists is a thrilling, funny, and touching adventure story, a tour-de-force of imagination that trenchantly explores our relationships to the cities around us and the technologies guiding us into the future. \"A new and irreverent take on both real-world politics and sci-fi history.\"-The Wall Street Journal",

            "description": "How will HG Wells react when he awakes 200 years in the future on a strange planet, faced with a terrible truth? Two young brothers make a frightening discovery about the neighbors. Do robots secretly want to rule us all? A scientist goes to extremes to change the future of mankind. But is it possible to change our destiny? Tales from another dimension is a strange and fantastical collection of ten short stories. Robbie Sheerin is inspired by classic Sci-fi, invoking nightmarish twists and turns with each story. Travel to another dimension and meet strange characters, sometimes human, and at times not so human. They will make you question the solidity of the earth and mankind. Explore prejudice, fear, imagination, kindness, empathy, and human frailty. \"The Truth Comes in Storms is wonderfully evocative -and the twist caught me completely unawares. Sheerin is a writer to keep an eye on!\"- Rob Yescombe. Writer of the movie \"Outside the Wire\" These stories are strong echoes of the classic science fiction of the 1950's, and bring back fond memories of the Twilight Zone.-Noel Chidwick. Founder and editor of the award winning sci-fi magazine Shoreline of Infinity ....Sheerin's Sci-if shorts engage the mind and senses with dread and wonder at the same time. What happens on the moon....stays on the moon, even it's from different planets.- ARZONO Publishing \"With a voice of clarity and surprise, Robbie Sheerin is well worth the quick and wondrous read each of his stories provides, the insight into our humanity (or inhumanity) they present, and the lasting impression they leave. Indulge and entertain yourself!\" - Jason J. Marchi, author of Venus Remembered with Ray Bradbury and the Barnes & Noble recognized bestseller The Legend of Hobbomock: The Sleeping Giant. Robbie Sheerin's insightful story \"The Protector\" is a chilling tale that underscores humanity's most troubling shortcomings. At its core, it reminds us that we must remain open-minded and compassionate toward those who are \"not like us\" or suffer the consequences..... ...\"The Future You Imagine, Doctor, Is Not The Future Of The Future\" is inventive and imaginative. In my opinion, all tales about our future should be appropriately apocalyptic.They should shake the foundations of our hopes and dreams .....- Leith MacArthur, author of \"The Death of Harry Crow\", from The William Snow Series of thrillers.",

            "description": "Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s masterpiece, Slaughterhouse-Five is \u201ca desperate, painfully honest attempt to confront the monstrous crimes of the twentieth century\u201d (Time). Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of all time Slaughterhouse-Five, an American classic, is one of the world\u2019s great antiwar books. Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber\u2019s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming \u201cunstuck in time.\u201d An instant bestseller, Slaughterhouse-Five made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut\u2019s writing\u2014the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit\u2014that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it. Authors as wide-ranging as Norman Mailer, John Irving, Michael Crichton, Tim O\u2019Brien, Margaret Atwood, Elizabeth Strout, David Sedaris, Jennifer Egan, and J. K. Rowling have all found inspiration in Vonnegut\u2019s words. Jonathan Safran Foer has described Vonnegut as \u201cthe kind of writer who made people\u2014young people especially\u2014want to write.\u201d George Saunders has declared Vonnegut to be \u201cthe great, urgent, passionate American writer of our century, who offers us . . . a model of the kind of compassionate thinking that might yet save us from ourselves.\u201d More than fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut\u2019s portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era\u2019s uncertainties.",

            "description": "Short science fiction and fantasy stories that, more often than not, end with a surprise or twist you couldn't see coming. Transport yourself to other lives and other worlds where travel through time and space is a reality and where second chances and the end of the world sometimes cross paths. It's a detour into the unknown filled with wonder and excitement beyond reality, and yet close enough, to make you second guess yourself. 1. So this is the End - An astronaut from the 1960's wakes up in a strange future in a deserted laboratory and falls in love with a beautiful lady astronaut from the future, kept there captive by unknown entities. Can they discover where they are and when? Are they the last remnants of humanity? 2. The Robber - An old thief goes back in time to finally obtain his much sought after, big score, only to discover a family secret that could have changed his life altogether. 3. The Search for Heaven - Somewhere in outer space in an unknown time, a man named Noah searches for Heaven through a wormhole and finds the unexpected. 4. The Fastest Gun Alive - A writer finds himself in his own story as his own wild west character. Can he survive long enough to get back home? 5. The Cave - A teenager enters a cave and emerges decades earlier running into his younger father living in the 1980's. 6. The End of Time - A group of time travelers saves Abraham Lincoln, but at what cost? 7. Angel of Death - A former lawman becomes a pastor of a small church in the old west, but can't outrun his violent past. Will he have to take up his guns again or will he get a hand from above? 8. Missing - A man's daughter disappears mysteriously into thin air. Where and when will he ever find her again? 9. By the Grace of God - A home inspector has his average life turned upside down. It all starts with a seriously strange unheeded premonition. 10. From My Cold Dead Hands - A hit man has one last chance at redemption before it's too late for all eternity. 11. Invasion from Outer Space - A group of teens in the 1950's witness what appears to be an alien invasion, but what is really happening will change their lives forever.",

In gratitude we freed them. With vengeance they betrayed us. When she's kidnapped by the Blessed Engineers, Arla discovers that she's been living a lie.

One act of rebellion leads to the fate of her people resting on her young shoulders. And, perhaps the future of humanity itself. Because Dawn harbors a secret. It is the key. Destiny awaits. Dawn Exodus is the first book in a now complete six book series of space opera in the classic vein of Asimov, Bradbury and Bear. If you like clean, fast paced, intelligent sci-fi that's full of ideas, memorable characters and examines what it truly is to be human, then the Robot Empire series is for you. \"Reminiscent of some of my favorite old time SciFi authors\" - Mark \"Inspired world building\" - Belle \"A brilliant read with an epic and unexpected ending\" - Bethany For readers who enjoy: Isaac Asimov's Foundation Star Wars Star Trek Battlestar Galactica The Orville The Expanse",

Rase can\u2019t believe his fated mate is in his arms. He also can\u2019t believe he crash laded on the last planet he\u2019d ever want to be on - that of the crime lord that wants himself and his brothers dead. He also won\u2019t bring himself to do the one thing that burns his blood to do and make love to his fated human female. Life doesn\u2019t last long here and he won\u2019t die and leave his mate possibly pregnant, helpless, alone and subject to the whims of the crime lord. Life hasn\u2019t been fantastic for Lexi, but being trapped in a cell with no privacy is the pits. Add to that a strange pull of attraction that\u2019s harder and harder to deny with an alien who tells her he is her fated mate and she\u2019s downright screwed. Figuratively and literally. Survival is doubtful, but Rase must act. He must escape the breeding cell, survive the fighting pits, save his exotic mate and end the reign of the biggest crime lord the ten Quadrant has ever known. Rescued by the Alien Space Pirate is the third novel in the Rasidian series. Although each novel is dedicated to its own couple, it\u2019s best to read this series in order. For fans of Ella Blake, Ava Ross and Lee Savino, this is a HOT romantic story with a guaranteed happily ever after. It includes some strong language, alien alpha males and oh my, steamy sexy times. Enjoy!",

Exploratory teams are accompanied by Company-supplied security androids, for their own safety. But in a society where contracts are awarded to the lowest bidder, safety isn\u2019t a primary concern.

No longer bound to the old ways of her people, she seeks her place in the galaxy, only to find as her father seizes power in Andlios he may be a puppet for figures from his own past. With the help of her old friends, she must venture out further into the galaxy than she ever has before, hoping to stop the Banished before it\u2019s too late. There\u2019s just one problem: the Khonsu revolution finds itself besieged by the Earth Ministry. After Khonsu Station and the gate went dark, Katrijn and Jace ventured through once more, in search of Loren and their friends. What they weren\u2019t expecting was their fragile intra-galaxy alliance hanging on by a thread as the Earth Ministry cut off Khonsu Station, looking to reclaim the station and quash the uprising before it could spread through the rest of the galaxy. Every revolution faces its past, but is that past too powerful to stop? *** KEYWORDS: science fiction, scifi book, scifi books, space opera book, space opera scifi, space opera adventure battles, science fiction female lead, strong female characters in books, anarchist scifi, cyborg fiction, space opera exploration, space viking book, anticapitalist scifi, existential scifi, scifi box set, epic space opera, scifi fantasy, space viking battles, lgbtq scifi, progressive scifi, hema battles scifi, space opera, science fiction cthulhu, lovecraftian, lovecraftian scifi For fans of: Frank Herbert, Dan Simmons, China Mieville, Isaac Asimov, Ursula K.

            "description": "Forget saving the universe. Take a walk on the tabloid side of science fiction where technologically superior aliens get lost, rednecks battle other-worldly invaders, and the Earth's sole contribution to galactic well-being is divorce litigation without nukes. Only in the pages of these pulpy, over-the-top, short stories can you blast a rabid Vork, prevent global catastrophe by a weather control machine run amok, cause an ice age, or have to clean up after a Nardian Hypotrich named \"Pooky.\" Author Mike Silvestri turns high-concept Sci Fi on its ear flaps when he rips twenty-eight of his humorous and altogether thought-provoking tales out of the supermarket checkout lane and puts them into your webbed flippers to read and enjoy.",
